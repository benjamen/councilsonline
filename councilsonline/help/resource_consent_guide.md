## Getting Started

### What is a Resource Consent?

A Resource Consent is permission to do something that would otherwise contravene the rules in a district plan, regional plan, or the Resource Management Act 1991 (RMA).

### Do I need a Resource Consent?

You may need a resource consent if your proposed activity:
- Doesn't comply with district plan rules
- Involves subdivision of land
- Requires a discharge permit (stormwater, wastewater)
- Needs a water permit (take, use, dam, or divert water)
- Requires a coastal permit (structures or activities in the coastal marine area)

**Always check your district plan first** - many activities are permitted and don't require consent.

## RMA Activity Status Guide

### What is Activity Status?

Activity status determines how council processes your application and what grounds they can use to decline it. **Check your district plan zone rules** to determine the status of your activity.

### Activity Status Types

#### Permitted Activity
- ✅ **No consent required**
- Activity fully complies with district plan rules
- Can proceed without an application

#### Controlled Activity
- ✅ **Consent must be granted**
- Council cannot decline the application
- Council sets conditions to manage effects
- Focus is on appropriate conditions, not whether to grant consent
- ⏱️ Usually processed within 20 working days

#### Restricted Discretionary Activity
- ⚠️ **Council has limited discretion**
- Council can only decline on specific matters listed in the plan
- Council's consideration restricted to matters specified in the plan
- ⏱️ Usually processed within 20 working days (non-notified)

#### Discretionary Activity
- ⚠️ **Council has full discretion**
- Council can grant or decline based on all relevant matters
- May require public notification depending on effects
- More detailed assessment required
- ⏱️ Processing time varies (20-130 working days depending on notification)

#### Non-Complying Activity
- 🚫 **Doesn't comply with district plan**
- Requires special justification
- Must demonstrate proposal is not contrary to plan objectives/policies
- Higher scrutiny and longer processing times
- Strong possibility of public notification
- 💡 **Consider pre-application meeting with council**

#### Prohibited Activity
- ❌ **Cannot be consented under any circumstances**
- Council cannot grant consent
- Activity not permitted by the plan
- Consider alternative approaches or locations

### How to Determine Activity Status

1. Check your property's **zone** (Residential, Rural, Commercial, etc.)
2. Look up your activity in the **district plan zone rules**
3. Check if you comply with all relevant standards (height, setbacks, site coverage, etc.)
4. If you breach a standard, check what activity status applies

**Need help?** Contact the council planning team or consider hiring a planning consultant.

## Assessment of Environmental Effects (AEE)

### What is an AEE?

The Assessment of Environmental Effects (AEE) is a detailed description of your proposal's actual and potential effects on the environment, as required by **Schedule 4 of the RMA**.

### What to Include

#### 1. Description of the Proposal
- What you're proposing to do
- Where it will occur
- When it will occur
- How it will be undertaken

#### 2. Effects on People
Consider and describe:
- **Privacy**: Will the proposal overlook neighboring properties?
- **Sunlight Access**: Will it cast shadows on neighbors?
- **Visual Amenity**: How will it look from surrounding properties?
- **Noise**: Construction noise and ongoing operational noise
- **Traffic**: Additional vehicle movements
- **Property Values**: Potential impact on surrounding properties

#### 3. Physical Effects
Consider and describe:
- **Traffic & Parking**: Vehicle trips, parking provision, road safety
- **Stormwater**: How will stormwater be managed?
- **Infrastructure**: Water, wastewater, electricity demands
- **Earthworks**: Soil disturbance, sediment control
- **Construction**: Dust, vibration, working hours

#### 4. Ecosystem Effects
Consider and describe:
- **Indigenous Vegetation**: Native trees, shrubs, plants
- **Habitat Values**: Wildlife corridors, bird nesting sites
- **Watercourses**: Streams, wetlands, water quality
- **Soil Quality**: Contamination, erosion
- **Natural Character**: Modification of natural features

#### 5. Cultural/Heritage Effects
Consider and describe:
- **Heritage Buildings**: Listed heritage sites nearby
- **Archaeological Sites**: Pre-1900 sites
- **Sites of Significance to Māori**: Waahi tapu, historic sites
- **Cultural Landscapes**: Areas of cultural importance

### Tips for Writing an AEE

✅ **Be specific and factual** - Use measurements, distances, and data

✅ **Be honest about effects** - Don't downplay genuine concerns

✅ **Explain mitigation** - For each effect, describe how you'll address it

✅ **Use specialist reports** - Reference technical assessments where relevant

✅ **Consider cumulative effects** - What happens combined with other activities?

✅ **Scale matters** - Level of detail should match the scale of effects:
   - Minor effects = brief AEE
   - Significant effects = detailed AEE with specialist reports

## Affected Parties

### Who are Affected Parties?

Affected parties are people or organizations that may be adversely affected by your proposal. This typically includes:
- Adjacent property owners
- Neighbors within sight/sound of the proposal
- Owners of properties that share access
- Utility providers
- Community groups

### Written Approvals

If you can obtain **written approval** from affected parties:
- Council may process your application without notification
- Faster processing (20 working days instead of 70+ for notified)
- Lower cost (no notification fees)
- Reduces risk of submissions in opposition

### How to Get Written Approvals

1. **Identify affected parties** - Who might be adversely affected?
2. **Prepare information pack**:
   - Plans and drawings
   - Description of proposal
   - Explanation of potential effects
   - Mitigation measures
3. **Meet in person** - Discuss the proposal face-to-face
4. **Address concerns** - Be prepared to make reasonable changes
5. **Get it in writing** - Use council's written approval form (if available)

### What if Someone Won't Give Approval?

- Document your consultation efforts
- Explain in your AEE what concerns they raised
- Describe what mitigation you've proposed to address concerns
- Council will consider their views in the decision
